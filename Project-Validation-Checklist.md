# Project Validation Checklist
## Testing the Game Foundation Before Student Handoff

This checklist ensures all components work properly before giving the project to students.

## Pre-Handoff Testing Requirements

### ✅ Documentation Completeness
- [ ] **README.md** clearly explains the RPG project
- [ ] **LearningPlan.md** has all 40 days of RPG-specific tasks
- [ ] **LLM-Assistant-Guide.md** covers RPG Maker topics
- [ ] **Student-Getting-Started.md** provides clear first steps
- [ ] **Day-1-Tasks.md** has specific, achievable tasks
- [ ] **RPG-Project-Setup.md** has technical implementation details

### ✅ Game Design Documentation
- [ ] **Map-Design-Templates.md** has detailed layouts
- [ ] **Character-Sprite-Specifications.md** has technical requirements
- [ ] **Story-Events-Script.md** has complete event scripts
- [ ] **Companion-System-Guide.md** explains Owl implementation
- [ ] **Placeholder-Assets-Guide.md** provides quick-start graphics

### ✅ Technical Validation

#### RPG Maker Project Structure
- [ ] **Variables 001-008** are properly defined with correct names
- [ ] **Switches 001-008** are set up for quest tracking
- [ ] **Actor 001** is configured as "Blue Planet Six"
- [ ] **Map naming** follows the template structure
- [ ] **Initial player position** is set correctly

#### Game Flow Testing
- [ ] **New project creation** works with provided instructions
- [ ] **Basic movement** functions properly
- [ ] **Simple events** (like refrigerator) trigger correctly
- [ ] **Text display** shows properly formatted dialogue
- [ ] **Map transfers** work between areas (when implemented)

### ✅ Learning Path Validation

#### Day 1 Achievability
- [ ] **Setup tasks** can be completed in 2-3 hours
- [ ] **Instructions are clear** for complete beginners
- [ ] **Success criteria** are measurable and achievable
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guidance** covers common issues
- [ ] **AI help integration** is properly explained

#### Weekly Progression
- [ ] **Week 1 tasks** build logically on each other
- [ ] **Difficulty progression** is appropriate for beginners
- [ ] **Asset creation** aligns with technical requirements
- [ ] **Story implementation** matches the design documents

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Common Setup Problems

#### RPG Maker Installation Issues
**Problem**: Student can't install or run RPG Maker  
**Solution**: Provide alternative free tools (RPG Maker MV vs MZ)  
**Mitigation**: Include troubleshooting section in getting started guide

#### Project Creation Confusion
**Problem**: Student creates project with wrong settings  
**Solution**: Very specific step-by-step instructions with screenshots  
**Mitigation**: Include "what success looks like" checkpoints

#### Database Setup Complexity
**Problem**: Variable/switch setup is overwhelming  
**Solution**: Provide copy-paste values and explain why each is needed  
**Mitigation**: Break database setup into smaller chunks across multiple days

### Learning Curve Issues

#### RPG Maker Interface Overwhelm
**Problem**: Too many buttons and options confuse beginners  
**Solution**: Focus on specific tools needed for each day's tasks  
**Mitigation**: "Don't worry about these other buttons yet" messaging

#### Event Logic Complexity
**Problem**: Event creation seems too technical  
**Solution**: Provide exact scripts to copy, explain concepts gradually  
**Mitigation**: Start with extremely simple events, build complexity slowly

#### Art Asset Creation Difficulty
**Problem**: Students get stuck trying to create perfect graphics  
**Solution**: Emphasize placeholder approach, art comes later  
**Mitigation**: Provide multiple options (recolor, generate, simple drawing)

## Quality Assurance Tests

### Beginner Experience Simulation
**Test**: Have someone unfamiliar with RPG Maker follow Day 1 instructions
- [ ] **Can complete setup** without external help
- [ ] **Understands what they accomplished** at each step
- [ ] **Feels successful and motivated** to continue
- [ ] **Knows where to get help** when stuck

### Content Accuracy Verification
**Test**: Verify all technical instructions work correctly
- [ ] **Variable numbers** match between documents
- [ ] **Switch references** are consistent across files
- [ ] **Map coordinates** and sizes are accurate
- [ ] **Event scripts** use correct RPG Maker syntax

### Learning Objective Alignment
**Test**: Ensure daily tasks match learning goals
- [ ] **Day 1** teaches basic RPG Maker navigation
- [ ] **Week 1** covers fundamental concepts
- [ ] **Month 1** provides complete mini-game experience
- [ ] **Full 40 days** results in polished, expandable RPG

## Final Validation Steps

### Student-Ready Checklist
Before handoff, ensure:
- [ ] **All documentation** is spell-checked and formatted
- [ ] **Technical instructions** have been tested by someone else
- [ ] **File organization** is clean and logical
- [ ] **Getting started process** takes under 30 minutes
- [ ] **Day 1 tasks** are completable by a beginner

### Instructor Support Materials
Prepare for common student questions:
- [ ] **FAQ document** with common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Screenshot gallery** showing what success looks like at each step
- [ ] **Video walkthrough** of Day 1 setup (optional but helpful)
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** for different operating systems

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Success (Day 1)
- Student creates working RPG Maker project
- Student successfully adds and tests their first event
- Student feels confident about continuing to Day 2

### Weekly Success (Days 1-7)  
- Student builds complete house map with multiple interactive elements
- Student understands basic event creation and testing
- Student begins creating or using character graphics

### Monthly Success (Days 1-30)
- Student has playable RPG with main story elements
- Student can independently create new maps and events
- Student feels capable of expanding the game beyond the tutorial
