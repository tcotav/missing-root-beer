# The Case of the Missing Root Beer

A silly mystery visual novel game created with Renpy, featuring a one-foot tall blue alien searching for his missing root beer and raccoon friend.

## Overview

"The Case of the Missing Root Beer" is an over-the-top, absurdist mystery game where players help Blue Planet Six track down his missing root beer and friend Pudding through the Alice in Wonderland-like headquarters of Miskko, a multi-planetary conglomerate run by a raccoon.

The game features:
- Multiple paths and endings
- A unique "annoyance sense" mechanic that guides the player
- Ridiculous characters and scenarios
- Classic mystery storytelling beats with an absurdist twist

## Characters

- **Blue Planet Six**: A ridiculous and not very bright one-foot-tall blue humanoid from a faraway planet
- **Pudding**: A raccoon, not very bright, but incredibly kind and hardworking
- **Owl**: Blue's best friend, annoyed, loves books
- **Miskers**: A mischievous overachieving raccoon who runs Miskko
- **Scrappy Blue**: Blue's nephew, an annoying smaller version of Blue (and the culprit!)

## Game Mechanics

- **Annoyance Level**: As Blue gets closer to clues left by Scrappy, his annoyance level increases
- **Clue Tracking**: Players collect clues throughout the investigation
- **Multiple Paths**: Different ways to approach the mystery with branching storylines
- **Multiple Endings**: Several possible conclusions based on player choices
