## Core Mystery Story Beats

- The Setup - Establish the normal world and introduce the protagonist(s). This is where we show what life is like before the mystery disrupts everything.
- The Inciting Incident - A crime/mystery occurs that demands investigation. This could be a murder, theft, disappearance, or any unusual event that needs solving.
- The Investigation Begins - The protagonist(s) start gathering initial clues and meeting potential suspects/witnesses.
- Red Herrings - False leads that temporarily misdirect both the protagonist and the player.
- The Midpoint Twist - A significant revelation that changes the understanding of the case, often deepening the mystery rather than solving it.
- Raising the Stakes - Something happens to make solving the mystery more urgent (another crime, threat to protagonist, time limit introduced).
- The Dark Night of the Soul - A moment where solving the case seems impossible, and the protagonist faces their greatest challenge.
- The Final Clue - The discovery that allows everything to fall into place.
- The Resolution - The mystery is solved, the culprit is revealed, and loose ends are tied up.
- The New Normal - How the world/characters have changed after solving the mystery.
