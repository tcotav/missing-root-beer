## Getting Help with AI
Throughout this learning journey, you can use AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Claude, or others) to get help with coding questions, creative ideas, and problem-solving. **See the [LLM-Assistant-Guide.md](LLM-Assistant-Guide.md) file for detailed instructions on how to effectively use AI as your learning partner.** This guide includes sample questions for each week, debugging tips, and best practices for learning with AI assistance.

## Learning Objectives Met:
- **Programming**: Ren'Py scripting, conditional logic, variables
- **Art**: Digital art creation, sprite design, background composition
- **Audio**: Sound editing, music integration, voice recording
- **Game Design**: Player choice consequences, pacing, user experience
- **Project Management**: Task planning, version control, testing
- **Problem Solving**: Debugging, optimization, feature implementation

## ADHD-Friendly Adaptations:
- **Clear Daily Goals**: Each day has specific, achievable objectives
- **Variety**: Different types of tasks (art, code, audio) to maintain interest
- **Immediate Feedback**: Regular testing to see results of work
- **Creative Freedom**: Room for personal artistic expression
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual completion of features and story elements
- **Break Tasks**: Can be split into smaller 30-60 minute sessions

## Project Benefits:
The project is perfectly set up as a learning vehicle! The existing story has:
- **Complete narrative structure** with multiple branching paths and endings
- **Rich character relationships** the teen already understands
- **Missing visual/audio assets** providing clear creative tasks
- **Room for expansion** without breaking existing functionality
- **Built-in complexity** that can be enhanced gradually

This structure will let the teenager start with simple asset creation and gradually work up to more complex features like inventory systems and mini-games, all while building on characters and a story they already know and love.
