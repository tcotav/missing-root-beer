## Getting Help with AI
Throughout this learning journey, you can use AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Claude, or others) to get help with coding questions, creative ideas, and problem-solving. **See the [LLM-Assistant-Guide.md](LLM-Assistant-Guide.md) file for detailed instructions on how to effectively use AI as your learning partner.** This guide includes sample questions for each week, debugging tips, and best practices for learning with AI assistance.

- **Art**: Character sprite creation, tileset usage, map design, and UI customization
- **Audio**: Music integration, sound effects, and ambient audio design
- **Game Design**: Quest systems, exploration mechanics, player progression, and story pacing
- **Project Management**: Task planning, feature implementation, testing, and documentation
- **Problem Solving**: Debugging events, optimizing performance, and balancing gameplay

## ADHD-Friendly Adaptations:
- **Clear Daily Goals**: Each day has specific, achievable objectives
- **Variety**: Different types of tasks (art, code, audio) to maintain interest
- **Immediate Feedback**: Regular testing to see results of work
- **Creative Freedom**: Room for personal artistic expression
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual completion of features and story elements
- **Break Tasks**: Can be split into smaller 30-60 minute sessions

## Project Benefits:
The RPG adaptation is perfectly designed as a learning vehicle! The story provides:
- **Established characters and world** that translate naturally to RPG exploration
- **Clear quest structure** with the root beer mystery as the main storyline
- **Multiple areas to design** (home, overworld, Miskko HQ) providing varied mapping challenges
- **Character progression** through relationship building and story discovery
- **Expandable gameplay** that can grow in complexity as skills develop

This structure lets learners start with basic map creation and character movement, then gradually add complex features like quest systems, inventory mechanics, and interactive storytelling, all while working with familiar characters and plot elements.
