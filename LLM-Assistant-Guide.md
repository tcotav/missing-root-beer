## How to Ask Effective Questions

### Be Specific
❌ **Poor**: "My game doesn't work"
✅ **Good**: "I'm getting a 'KeyError: 'blue_normal'' error when trying to show my character sprite. Here's the code: [paste code]"

### Provide Context
❌ **Poor**: "How do I add music?"
✅ **Good**: "I'm working on Day 21 of my learning plan and want to add background music to the home scene in my Ren'Py game. I have an .ogg file ready."

### Include Your Current Skill Level
❌ **Poor**: "Explain variables"
✅ **Good**: "I'm new to programming and working on a Ren'Py game. Can you explain how variables work in simple terms with an example from my mystery game?"

### Ask for Learning, Not Just Answers
❌ **Poor**: "Write the code for an inventory system"
✅ **Good**: "Can you guide me through creating a simple inventory system for my Ren'Py game? I want to understand each step so I can modify it later."

## Debugging with AI

### Common Error Types and How to Ask for Help

**Syntax Errors**
- Copy the exact error message
- Include the line of code causing the error
- Ask: "I'm getting this error: [error message]. Here's my code: [code]. What does this mean and how do I fix it?"

**Logic Errors**
- Describe what you expected to happen
- Describe what actually happened
- Ask: "My game should do X when I click Y, but instead it does Z. Here's the relevant code: [code]"

**Asset Loading Issues**
- Include file names and folder structure
- Copy the error message
- Ask: "My image/audio file won't load. Here's my file structure and the error: [details]"

## Creative Collaboration Tips

### Brainstorming Sessions
- Ask open-ended questions: "What are some creative ways Blue could discover clues?"
- Request alternatives: "Give me 5 different ways this scene could end"
- Seek inspiration: "What are some funny situations that could happen in a corporate headquarters?"

### Character Development
- Ask for character backstories: "Help me develop Pudding's background story"
- Request dialogue examples: "Show me how Scrappy Blue would react to being caught"
- Explore relationships: "How could Blue and Owl's friendship be developed further?"

### Story Enhancement
- Ask for plot twists: "What unexpected reveals could make the mystery more interesting?"
- Request pacing advice: "Does this story flow well? How can I improve the pacing?"
- Seek feedback: "What parts of my story might be confusing to players?"

## Learning Best Practices

### Use AI as a Teacher, Not a Shortcut
- Ask for explanations, not just solutions
- Request step-by-step guidance
- Ask follow-up questions to deepen understanding
- Practice what you learn before moving on

### Verify and Test Everything
- AI can make mistakes, so always test suggested code
- Cross-reference important information with official documentation
- Ask for multiple approaches to compare options
- Build understanding gradually rather than copying complex solutions

### Keep Learning Active
- Try to modify AI suggestions to fit your specific needs
- Ask "What if" questions to explore alternatives
- Request explanations for why certain approaches are recommended
- Use AI to explain concepts you find in tutorials or documentation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### When AI Responses Don't Work
1. **Provide more context** about your specific setup
2. **Ask for simpler alternatives** if the solution is too complex
3. **Request step-by-step breakdown** of complex solutions
4. **Specify your Ren'Py version** as syntax can vary

### When You're Stuck
1. **Break down the problem** into smaller parts
2. **Ask for learning resources** on the specific topic
3. **Request examples** from similar games or situations
4. **Ask for debugging strategies** rather than just fixes

### When You Need Inspiration
1. **Ask for brainstorming sessions** on specific topics
2. **Request examples** from other games in your genre
3. **Ask for creative constraints** to spark ideas
4. **Seek feedback** on your current ideas

## Remember: AI is Your Learning Partner

- AI can provide guidance, but you're building the skills
- Always understand the code before using it
- Experiment and modify suggestions to make them your own
- Use AI to accelerate learning, not replace it
- Ask questions when you don't understand something
- The goal is to become an independent game developer
