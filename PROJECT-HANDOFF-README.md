## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: What if a student doesn't have RPG Maker?
**A:** Free trials are available, or consider RPG Maker MV which goes on sale frequently. Alternative: Use the project as a design exercise first.

### Q: Can this work for different age groups?
**A:** Yes! Designed for teens but adaptable:
- **Younger (10-13)**: Focus more on creativity, less on technical implementation
- **Older (16+)**: Add programming challenges, advanced features
- **Adults**: Emphasize project management and professional development skills

### Q: How much instructor support is needed?
**A:** Minimal daily support needed:
- **Day 1**: High support for setup
- **Week 1**: Medium support for concept learning  
- **Weeks 2-6**: Low support, mostly encouragement and troubleshooting

### Q: What if students want to deviate from the plan?
**A:** Encourage creativity! The plan provides structure, but personal expression makes it engaging. Common deviations:
- Different character designs
- Additional story elements  
- New areas or mechanics
- Unique art style choices

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Technical Issues
- **RPG Maker won't start**: Check system requirements, try administrator mode
- **Project won't open**: Verify file permissions, check for corrupted files
- **Events don't work**: Review event setup in Story-Events-Script.md
- **Graphics problems**: Start with placeholders, perfect art later

### Learning Issues
- **Student overwhelmed**: Break tasks into smaller chunks, focus on one concept at a time
- **Student behind schedule**: Prioritize core functionality over polish
- **Student ahead of schedule**: Provide extension challenges from Week 7-8 content
- **Student losing motivation**: Celebrate small wins, show progress to others

## Extension Opportunities

### For Advanced Students
- **Custom scripting**: Add JavaScript plugins for new features
- **Advanced art**: Create professional-quality sprites and tilesets
- **Sound design**: Compose original music and sound effects
- **Game distribution**: Publish to web or mobile platforms

### For Continued Learning
- **New projects**: Create entirely original games using learned skills
- **Collaboration**: Work with other students on larger projects
- **Community involvement**: Share creations with RPG Maker community
- **Career preparation**: Build portfolio for game development programs
